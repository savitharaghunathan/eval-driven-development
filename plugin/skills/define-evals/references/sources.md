## Agent Memory Evaluation

- [Memory for Autonomous LLM Agents: Mechanisms, Evaluation, and Emerging Frontiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.07670) — Pengfei Du, arXiv, March 2026. Survey of agent memory systems. Proposes four-layer metric stack (effectiveness, memory quality, efficiency, governance). Key findings: cross-session coherence is unsolved, nobody evaluates forgetting well, memory architecture often matters more than model choice.

## Non-Coding Agent Evaluation (Research Papers)

- [tau-bench: A Benchmark for Tool-Agent-User Interaction in Real-World Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12045) — Yao, Shinn, Razavi, Narasimhan. Retail & airline customer service agent benchmark. Introduced pass^k metric.
- [tau2-bench: Evaluating Conversational Agents in a Dual-Control Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07982) — Telecom domain, dual-control where both agent and user use tools.
- [Capability-Aligned Human-Centred Evaluation Framework for Conversational AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08253) — arXiv, May 2025. Evaluates coherence, accuracy, clarity, relevance, efficiency in dialogue.
- [Survey on Evaluation of LLM-based Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16416) — arXiv, March 2025. First comprehensive survey across all agent types and evaluation frameworks.

## Harness Engineering Evaluation

- [Harness Engineering](https://martinfowler.com/articles/harness-engineering.html) — Birgitta Boeckeler, April 2026. Four-part taxonomy (guides, sensors, computational, inferential elements). Key gap: no equivalent of code coverage for harness quality.
- [Inside the Scaffold: A Source-Code Taxonomy of Coding Agent Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.03515) — Rombaut, April 2026. Analyzes 13 agents across 12 dimensions. Tool accuracy drops past 15-20 tools. Context compaction strategies diverge most across architectures.
- [Meta-Harness: End-to-End Optimization of Model Harnesses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.28052) — Lee et al., March 2026. Harness optimizations transfer across models — infrastructure improvements yield gains regardless of which LLM you use.
- [Effective Harnesses for Long-Running Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents) — Young (Anthropic), November 2025. Two critical failure modes: over-ambition (context exhaustion mid-task) and premature completion.
- [Codified Context: Infrastructure for AI Agents in a Complex Codebase](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20478) — Vasilopoulos, February 2026. Hot/cold memory separation across 283 sessions. Tests domain-expert routing and compaction fidelity.
- [Natural-Language Agent Harnesses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.25723) — March 2026. Scaffold differences dominate outcomes even under fixed base models.

## Skill Evaluation

- [Evaluating Skills](https://www.langchain.com/blog/evaluating-skills) — Robert Xu, LangChain, March 2026. Skill invocation as first-class metric. Bug-fixing as superior eval paradigm (constrained tasks easier to grade). ~12 skill ceiling for reliable disambiguation. Baseline comparison methodology (control vs. treatment). Full trajectory observability required for iteration. Claude Code with skills: 82% task completion vs. 9% without.
