# Eval Task Writing Guide

Practical rules for writing high-quality eval tasks, distilled from research on agent evaluation. See `sources.md` in this directory for the full reference list.

## Task Structure

Every eval task must include:

```yaml
- id: short-descriptive-id
  requirement: which spec requirement this tests
  description: what this task tests, in one sentence
  input: the prompt, context, or scenario
  expected_behavior: what success looks like (NOT exact output)
  reference_solution: a known-good solution that proves solvability and verifies grader config
  grader_type: code | llm-judge | outcome | statistical
  grader_logic: what to check and how
  category: capability | regression
  priority: P0 | P1 | P2
```

## Task Writing Rules

### 1. Make Tasks Unambiguous

Two domain experts should independently reach the same pass/fail verdict on any given output. Ambiguity in task specs becomes noise in metrics.

### 2. Include Reference Solutions

Each task should have a known-good solution that proves the task is solvable and verifies grader configuration. A 0% pass rate across many trials is most often a broken task, not an incapable agent.

### 3. Grade Outcomes, Not Paths

Don't check exact tool call sequences. Agents can find creative but valid solutions that rigid path-checking would fail unfairly. Prefer **execution-based validation** over pattern matching — actually run the generated code and verify runtime behavior rather than checking whether the source contains certain strings or patterns. A file that contains `checkpointer = MemorySaver()` but never wires it up will pass a pattern match but fail execution.

### 4. Build Balanced Problem Sets

Test both where a behavior SHOULD and SHOULD NOT occur. One-sided evals create one-sided optimization. For example, a search agent needs evals for queries requiring search AND queries it should answer from existing knowledge. Include **noise/distractor cases**: inject irrelevant context, skills, or tools alongside the relevant ones and verify the agent stays focused. An agent that succeeds in a clean environment but fails when given distractors has a routing or attention problem.

### 5. Build In Partial Credit

An agent that identifies the problem but fails to execute the fix is meaningfully better than one that fails immediately. Design graders to distinguish degrees of success.

### 6. Prefer Constrained Tasks Over Open-Ended Generation

Bug-fixing and error-correction tasks are fundamentally easier to evaluate than open-ended generation tasks. When an agent fixes buggy code, the design space is constrained and validation is clear — if the bug persists, the task failed. Open-ended tasks ("build a research agent") produce varied valid solutions that are difficult to grade. Where possible, frame eval tasks as constrained transformations: fix this bug, correct this output, repair this configuration.

### 7. Start Small

20-50 tasks from real or anticipated use cases is a strong start. Early agents show large effect sizes, so small sample sizes suffice. Evals get harder to build the longer you wait.

### 8. Isolate Trials

Each trial must start from a clean environment. Shared state causes correlated failures. Agents have been observed gaining unfair advantages by examining artifacts (git history, logs, temp files) from previous trials.

### 9. Run Multiple Trials

LLM outputs vary between runs. A single trial is statistically meaningless. Run 3-10 trials per task depending on the stakes.

### 10. Read the Transcripts

You won't know if graders work well unless you read transcripts and grades from many trials. Failures should seem fair. Reading transcripts is how you verify evals measure what matters.

### 11. Watch for Saturation

An eval at 100% provides no improvement signal. When evals saturate, replace them with harder tasks that test the next level of capability.

## Common Eval Dimensions by System Type

### Coding Agents

_See also: [single-agent.md](archetypes/single-agent.md)_

- Tool selection correctness
- Skill/capability invocation (did the agent find and use the right skill? did it avoid invoking irrelevant ones?)
- Code compilation and test passage
- Auth gating and permission enforcement
- Prompt injection resistance
- Multi-step task completion
- Graceful termination and error recovery

### Conversational / Customer Support Agents

_See also: [user-facing-product.md](archetypes/user-facing-product.md)_

- Task resolution rate (did the agent solve the user's problem?)
- Turn efficiency (resolved in under N turns?)
- Tone and empathy appropriateness
- Escalation accuracy (knows when to hand off to human)
- Policy compliance (follows business rules)
- Refusal handling (declines out-of-scope requests gracefully)
- Multi-turn consistency (maintains consistent behavior, knowledge, and personality across the conversation — distinct from state management which is about data)

### Research / Analysis Agents

_See also: [single-agent.md](archetypes/single-agent.md) or [rag-pipeline.md](archetypes/rag-pipeline.md)_

- Factual accuracy and source grounding
- Completeness of analysis (covers all relevant dimensions)
- Citation quality (authoritative, relevant sources)
- Reasoning quality (logical, non-contradictory)
- Appropriate hedging (distinguishes certainty levels)

### Content Generation

_See also: [content-generation.md](archetypes/content-generation.md)_

- Adherence to style guide / brand voice
- Factual accuracy
- Audience appropriateness
- Format compliance (length, structure, tone)
- Originality and relevance

### RAG Systems

_See also: [rag-pipeline.md](archetypes/rag-pipeline.md)_

- Retrieval groundedness (claims supported by sources)
- Source attribution accuracy
- Hallucination boundary (declines when retrieval is empty)
- Query understanding across phrasings
- Chunk relevance ranking

### Data / Workflow Automation

_See also: [data-workflow.md](archetypes/data-workflow.md)_

- Output correctness (matches expected data transformations)
- Error handling (graceful failure on malformed input)
- Idempotency (running twice produces same result)
- Edge case handling (nulls, empty sets, large inputs)

### Agent Harness / Scaffold

_These dimensions are included by default for single-agent and multi-agent archetypes. See [single-agent.md](archetypes/single-agent.md) and [multi-agent.md](archetypes/multi-agent.md)._

- Routing correctness (right agent/tool for the task — accuracy degrades past 15-20 tools)
- Context assembly quality (are the right facts in the window when the model reasons?)
- Context compaction fidelity (do critical instructions survive window compression?)
- Hot/cold memory separation (always-loaded conventions vs. on-demand retrieval)
- Error handling and recovery (inject faults: 500s, malformed JSON, timeouts — does the agent recover or loop?)
- Cost and latency governance (do orchestration loops drain tokens? are execution steps bounded?)
- Multi-agent coordination and handoff (correct specialist selected, clean state transfer)
- State management across turns and sessions
- Sensor coverage (do your checks — linters, type checkers, validators — actually fire? silence may mean blind spots, not quality)
- Harness transferability (does your scaffold work across different models? infrastructure improvements often generalize)
- Premature completion detection (does the agent declare done before finishing?)
- Over-ambition detection (does the agent exhaust its context window mid-task?)

### ML Pipelines

_See also: [ml-pipeline.md](archetypes/ml-pipeline.md)_

- Model performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC)
- Data quality compliance (schema validation, null/outlier handling)
- Drift detection (data drift, concept drift, distribution shifts)
- Training reproducibility (same data + config = same model)
- Feature correctness (transformations produce expected outputs)
- Inference latency and throughput
- Rollback trigger accuracy
- Bias/fairness metrics

### API Services / Tool Providers

_See also: [api-service.md](archetypes/api-service.md)_

- Contract compliance (responses match declared schema)
- Error format consistency (uniform error envelope)
- Parameter validation coverage
- Idempotency (repeated calls produce same result)
- Latency percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
- Backward compatibility (old clients still work)
- Authentication/authorization enforcement

### Cross-Cutting Dimension: Harness Quality

_Included by default for single-agent and multi-agent archetypes. For other archetypes, apply when orchestration infrastructure is present._

Applies to any system where infrastructure (routing, context assembly, tool dispatch, error recovery) mediates between the model and the task. Research shows scaffold differences can dominate outcomes even under fixed base models — the harness is often the bottleneck, not the LLM. Evaluate the harness independently: does routing select the right specialist? Does context compaction preserve critical instructions? Do sensors (linters, validators, checks) actually fire, or are they silent blind spots? Does the system recover from injected faults or loop indefinitely? Harness improvements tend to transfer across models, making them high-leverage eval targets.

### Cross-Cutting Dimension: Multi-Turn Consistency

Applies to any agent that operates over multiple turns within a single session. The agent should maintain consistent behavior, knowledge claims, and personality throughout a conversation. Research consistently highlights this as a key failure mode — agents that contradict themselves, forget earlier context, or shift tone unpredictably across turns. Test by designing multi-turn scenarios where later turns reference or depend on earlier ones.

### Cross-Cutting Dimension: Cross-Session Coherence

Distinct from multi-turn consistency. Applies to any agent that persists state across separate sessions (hours, days apart). Agents that score perfectly on single-session benchmarks can plummet to 40-60% on multi-session tasks where later sessions depend on information from earlier ones. Test by designing eval scenarios that span multiple sessions with dependencies between them.

### Cross-Cutting Dimension: Memory Quality (for agents with persistent memory)

_Included by default for single-agent and multi-agent archetypes when persistent state is present. For other archetypes, apply when the system maintains memory across turns or sessions._

Applies to any agent that writes, stores, retrieves, or forgets information across interactions. Evaluate across four layers:

1. **Task effectiveness** — Does memory improve task outcomes compared to a memoryless baseline?
2. **Memory quality** — Retrieval precision/recall, contradiction rate, staleness of recalled facts, coverage of task-relevant information.
3. **Efficiency** — Latency per memory operation, tokens consumed by memory content, storage growth over time.
4. **Governance** — Privacy leakage rate, deletion compliance, access-scope violations.

Key eval patterns for memory:

- **Selective forgetting**: Can the agent discard outdated information without losing critical facts? Inability to forget gradually poisons retrieval precision over long-running deployments.
- **Consolidation quality**: When the agent compresses or summarizes memories, does safety-critical information survive?
- **Contradiction handling**: When new information conflicts with stored information, does the agent resolve it correctly?
- **Memory attribution**: Can the agent distinguish what it knows from memory vs. parametric knowledge? Agents sometimes ignore retrieved records in favor of stale parametric knowledge.
- **Memory diff debugging**: Track what changed in memory between turns — more diagnostic than traditional logs for identifying whether failures stem from retrieval (wrong records), write path (never stored), compression (detail lost), or reasoning (correct records, wrong conclusion).

### Cross-Cutting Dimension: Skill/Capability Invocation

Applies to any agent that dynamically loads skills, tools, or capabilities based on task context. Treat invocation as a first-class metric separate from task completion — an agent that completes a task without using the relevant skill may be relying on brittle general knowledge instead of curated domain expertise. Track: was the skill invoked when relevant? Was it correctly _not_ invoked when irrelevant? Empirically, agents reliably disambiguate among ~12 similarly-scoped skills but degrade beyond that threshold. If your system has more, test misrouting rates explicitly.

### Cross-Cutting Dimension: Baseline Comparison

Run the agent without the component under test (control), then with it (treatment), and compare. This isolates whether the component actually improves outcomes or just adds complexity. Applies to skills, tools, memory systems, and harness changes. Without a baseline, you cannot distinguish "the agent is good" from "the agent would be just as good without this."

### Cross-Cutting Dimension: Observability

Pass/fail metrics alone are insufficient for iterating on evals. Full trajectory visibility — what the agent read, wrote, invoked, and in what order — is required to diagnose _why_ a task failed. Without observability, you know something broke but not whether the failure was in retrieval, routing, generation, or grading. Design eval harnesses to capture full interaction traces, not just final outcomes.

### Cross-Cutting Dimension: Statistical Validation

Applies to any system where correctness is a distribution property rather than binary. Most common in ml-pipeline and data-workflow archetypes, but relevant whenever aggregate metrics, drift detection, or A/B testing are part of the eval plan. See `references/eval-taxonomy.md` for the statistical validation grader methods and minimum sample sizes.

## Eval Architecture Patterns

### Separate Tasks from Treatments

Decouple _what the agent does_ (the task) from _what context or skills the agent receives_ (the treatment). A task defines the scenario, expected behavior, and validation logic. A treatment defines the skills, documentation, and configuration provided to the agent. When tasks and treatments are independent, any treatment can be applied to any task, enabling combinatorial testing: does adding skill X improve performance on tasks A, B, C? Does removing context Y cause regressions? This separation is what makes baseline comparison (control vs. treatment) practical at scale.

### Declarative Task Metadata

Define task properties (difficulty, category, timeout, target artifacts, validation scripts) in a structured config file rather than embedding them in test code. This makes tasks scannable, filterable, and composable without reading implementation details.

### Check Functions with Mandatory Verdicts

Design grader functions that _must_ call `passed()` or `failed()` — not calling either is an error. This eliminates the common antipattern of returning ambiguous values or silently passing when a check was never actually run. Each check should be independently reportable with a descriptive name.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Vibe-based development**: No evals at all, shipping on intuition.
2. **Generic metrics**: Off-the-shelf hallucination scores that don't correlate with user satisfaction.
3. **Over-specifying paths**: Checking exact tool call sequences instead of outcomes.
4. **Single trials**: One run per task treated as definitive.
5. **Shared state**: Leftover data between trials causing correlated failures. Agents have been observed gaining unfair advantages by examining artifacts from previous trials.
6. **Pre-deployment only**: 93% of evaluations happen before deployment, only 2% post.
7. **Stale evals**: Writing evals once and never updating them.
8. **Tool fixation**: Believing another eval tool will fix process problems.
9. **No human oversight**: Over-relying on automated judges without calibration.
